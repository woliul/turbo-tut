Awesome. Let’s begin **Week 1, Lesson 1** — this is your very first step in writing Python like a real developer.

# 🧪 Week 1, Lesson 1: Inputs, Outputs, and Basic Structure

## 🎯 Goal:
Understand how to take input, process it, and give output — the core loop of any app.

---

## 👨‍💻 Mini Task:
> Build a small Python script that asks the user's name and age, then prints how old they'll be in 5 years.

---

## 🧱 Concepts You’ll Learn:
- `print()` – display output  
- `input()` – get user input  
- `int()` – convert string to number  
- Simple math and string formatting  

---

### ✅ Step-by-step Instructions:

#### 🥇 Step 1: Set up a place to write Python
Choose one:
- Use [https://replit.com](https://replit.com) (no install needed)
- Or VSCode with Python installed
- Or Google Colab (also browser-based, good for beginners)

Let me know if you need help setting it up.

### 🧑‍💻 Step 2: Start with this code structure:

```python
# Ask the user for their name and age
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

# Convert age to an integer
age = int(age)

# Calculate future age
future_age = age + 5

# Print the result
print("Hello", name + "!")
print("In 5 years, you will be", future_age, "years old.")
```

### 🔍 What’s Happening Here?

| Line      | What it does                              |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `input()` | Gets input from the user as a string      |
| `int()`   | Converts string to integer (for age math) |
| `+`       | Adds years to age                         |
| `print()` | Shows the output                          |

---

### 🧪 Your Turn:
Try typing or pasting the code into your editor.

Then:
1. Run it
2. Enter your name and age when asked
3. See the result!

If it gives any error, copy-paste it here — I’ll explain and fix it with you.
